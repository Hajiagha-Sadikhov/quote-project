The most effective way is to destabilize your old belief shake your certainty by questioning it. Remember that your brain is always trying to move you away from pain, so think about all the negative consequences this belief has caused. Ask yourself: 1) As I reconsider it, what's actually silly, ridiculous, or stupid about this belief? 2) What has this belief already cost me? How has it limited me in the past? 3) What could it cost me in the future if I don't change now? Answering these types of questions will help you associate painful feelings to the old, undesired belief and provide you with the opportunity to replace it with an empowering one."
